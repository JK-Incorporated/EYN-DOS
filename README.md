# EYN-DOS Experimental (Most recent)

---

The modern DOS Operating Environment for PC's with pre-existing operating systems. A nostalgia pleaser.

EYN-DOS is a recreation of classic DOS Operating Systems from the early 80's to late 90's.

In order to run EYN-DOS, you have to have Python 3.x and the 'colorama' module installed on your host PC. To install Colorama, type 'pip install colorama' in your host system terminal. For Windows, type 'cmd' into the search bar and press enter. For Linux, press Ctrl, Alt, and T at the same time.

To run EYN-DOS, run it in your host PC's main terminal or run the Python file directly as an executable (Windows only).

Simply run EYN-DOS by typing "python3 RUNMEFIRST.py" or ".\RUNMEFIRST.py" in your terminal. Alternatively, you can run "C.py" if you're in a rush. "RUNMEFIRST.py" simply runs an intro and tests if the "os" module is functioning.

We hope you have a wonderful time using EYN-DOS!
