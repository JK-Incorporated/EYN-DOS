number=1 # assigns the variable 'number' to the number 1

while True: # true is true by default, if that makes sense. its always true unless said otherwise.
    print(int(number)) # prints the variable in a loop
    number=number+1 # assigns the 'number' the value of itself, plus 1. this makes it so when its printed, it continues on with the code and sees the new value, then it goes back to print then sees it again, and so on,

# i dont understand why youre reading the comments in a file called 'counter.py'. it sorta explains itself.
